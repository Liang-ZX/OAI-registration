Morphology   
================================================================================

*pyKNEEr* computes two quantitative parameters to characterize femoral cartilage morphology:

- **Thickness**, calculated in two steps:

  - Separation of subcondral surface and articular surface of the cartilage
  - Calculation of the distance between the two surfaces using a **nearest neighbor** method

- **Volume**, calculated as the volume of the cartilage mask multiplied by the voxel volume

.. note::

   You can calculate cartilage thickness and volume **independently**, although their computations are implemented in the same notebook

Input: Image folder list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the demo images, the input file is ``image_list_morphology.txt``, which contains:

.. code-block:: python

    [1] ./segmented
    [2] 01_DESS_01_prep_fc.mha

where:

- Line 1: Input folder, containing the cartilage masks
- Line 2: Name of cartilage mask

.. note::

    When using **your own data**:

    - Customize ``image_list_morphology.txt`` with path and names of your own binary masks


Executing morphology.ipynb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compute femoral cartilage morphology:

- :ref:`Launch <launch_jup>` Jupyter notebook
- In *File Browser*, navigate to ``morphology.ipynb``, open it, and:

  - Customize the input variables :

    - ``n_of_cores`` (:ref:`How do I choose the number of cores? <cores>`)
    - ``output_file_name_thickness``
    - ``output_file_name_volume``

  - Follow the instructions in the notebook
  - *Note*: Cartilage thickness and volume are **calculated independently**, so it is not necessary to calculate thickness before calculating the volume

- :ref:`Save <save_jup>` your notebook at the end of the process


Output: Surfaces, thicknesses, and volumes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The outputs are in the folder ``.morphology``. For each subject, the outputs are:

- ``*_boneCart.txt``: Subchondral surface of the cartilage as a points cloud.
  Each row corresponds to a point, and the three columns correspond to the x, y, and z coordinates
- ``*_artiCart.txt``: Articular surface of the cartilage as a points cloud
- ``thickness_ID.txt``: List of thicknesses in mm associated to the surface points

  ``ID`` is the algorithm chosen to calculate cartilage thickness:

  1. Nearest neighbor calculated on the femur surface
  2. Nearest neighbor calculated on the articular surface

- ``volume.txt``: Cartilage volume in mm :sup:`3`



Visualization: Map, graph, and table
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cartilage **thickness** is visualized as:

- *Map*: Thickness values are a colormap on the cartilage surface, flattened after interpolation to a cylinder [1]. The same flattening algorithm is used to visualize subcondral and articular cartilage after splitting
- *Graph*: Dots represent the average value of cartilage thickness per image and bars represent the standard deviation
- *Table*: Thickness average and standard deviation, also saved as ``.csv`` file for subsequent analysis

.. figure:: _figures/cartilageThickness.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

Cartilage **volume** is visualized as:

- *Graph*: Dots represent volume per image
- *Table*: Volume values, also saved as ``.csv`` file for subsequent analysis


.. figure:: _figures/cartilageVolume.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%
